🎧 Spotify UI Clone — HTML & CSS

This project is a Spotify-inspired music player UI clone, built using pure HTML and CSS. The goal was to recreate a modern, clean, and visually appealing music player interface similar to Spotify, focusing on layout, styling, alignment, and UI structure — without JavaScript functionality.

🚀 Features

✅ Spotify-style layout and design

✅ Song list with album covers, song titles, timestamps, and play icons

✅ Sticky bottom music control bar (play/next/previous buttons)

✅ Custom Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons

✅ Flexbox-based responsive structure

✅ Hover animations on icons and buttons
